## Stuff {.centering}

Centering a header will center the whole slide...

h<br> <!-- Sometimes a break is needed to properly arrange objects --> ![Test Image](images/testImage.png){width="50%"}

## Bullets

-   First level
    -   second level
    -   2b
    -   2c
        -   third level
    -   2d

## Numbered lists

Numbers must start under text on previous line and you need a newline:

1.  First level
    1.  second level
    2.  2b
    3.  2c
        1.  third level
    4.  2d

## Mixed lists

Numbers must start under text on previous line and you need a newline:

1.  First level
    -   second level
    -   2b
    -   2c
        1.  third level
        2.  3b
    -   2d
        1.  more here...

## Newlines

One really annoying thing about Quarto Is that you must put two spaces\
at the end of a line or a slash (\\)\
in order for it to go to the next line sdfasdf\
sadfasfddsaf asdfere\
sgdg

## Newlines in visual mode

How does Quarto

[spce]{class="centering"}

this

??

## Alignment and sizing

To change the properties of text inline:\
before [This will be bigger]{style="font-size: 70px;"} after\
before [This will be smaller and blue]{style="font-size: 10px;color: blue;"} after\
[This will be centered]{style="display: block; text-align: center;"}\
Centering is not encouraged...

## Columns

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
Left side of the column\
Next extra vertical spacing -- have to put in HTML breaks <br><br>\

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
Right side of the column\
More stuff

## Add classes

I will use a class on [this part]{.pageRef} of the text

Enter in visual mode with skip a line (annoying!)

Shift-enter does what you think enter should do...\
If you want to add multiple spaces,\
You need to       click control-shift-space (visual mode only\
REgular mode:        dfkghj

## Spacing an image

Sizing images: easier with percentages? ![](images/llamas-2.jpg){style="width: 400px; position: absolute;bottom:2%; right:2%; z-index:-1; opacity:0.5;"} <br><br><br><br><br> The image also is set to half transparent (opacity: 0.5) and set to go behind any other object like text (z-index: -1)

## Hyperlink Text

## Breaking GitHub cache

The CDN will always update when you push new files. If you want to test it (or break a cache) you can append a query string like myfile.jpg?ver=123 and every time you update the string the cache will bust, and you can verify that the CDN is updating
